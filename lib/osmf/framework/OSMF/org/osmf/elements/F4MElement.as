	/**
	 * F4MElement is a media element used to load media from F4M files.  F4M files are
	 * XML documents that adhere to the Flash Media Manifest format, and which represent
	 * all of the information needed to load and play a media file.
	 * 
	 * <p>The basic steps for creating and using an F4MElement are:
	 * <ol>
	 * <li>Create a new URLResource pointing to the URL of the F4M file.</li>
	 * <li>Create the new F4MElement, 
	 * passing the URLResource as a parameter.</li>
	 * <li>Create a new MediaPlayer.</li>
	 * <li>Assign the F4MElement to the MediaPlayer's <code>media</code> property.</li>
	 * <li>Control the media using the MediaPlayer's methods, properties, and events.</li>
	 * <li>When done with the F4MElement, set the MediaPlayer's <code>media</code>
	 * property to null.  This will unload the F4MElement.</li>
	 * </ol>
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Note: It is simplest to use the MediaPlayer class in conjunction with the F4MElement.
	 * If you work directly with an F4MElement, then it's important to listen for events
	 * related to traits being added and removed.  If you use the MediaPlayer class with an
	 * F4MElement, then the MediaPlayer will automatically listen for these events for you.</p>
