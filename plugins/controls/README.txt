3.2.9

3.2.8
-----
- Seek preview: When dragging using the scrubber the player now pauses and shows the video frame corresponding to the
  dragger position in the screen. Note that this is the closest keyframe corresponding to the dragger position.
  When the mouse is released and the dragging stops the player resumes playback.
- Does not show the progress bar any more with RTMP. Only the size of the back buffer and forward buffer are shown with bars.
- added 'disabledWidgetColor' option. Used for all widgets in disabled state. Defaults to #555555
Fixes:
- fixed a problem in the skinless version, a border was drawn around controls: http://flowplayer.org/forum/8/60060
- support of background images was broken: http://flowplayer.org/forum/8/60403
- It was not possible to change backgroundColor using JavaScript API's css() method: http://code.google.com/p/flowplayer-core/issues/detail?id=242
- The buffer bar now moves also in paused state if the player keeps buffering: http://code.google.com/p/flowplayer-core/issues/detail?id=249
- Time display showed the second value truncated. For example if the clip's duration was 3.8 it was showing a 3 second duration
  instead of the correct rounded value of 4 seconds.
- Fixed: Set autoPlay: false, move the scrub bar, its boundless and will keep moving past the player dimensions. Issue #332
- #349 if we click or drag to seek to zero the calculation includes dragger dimensions so is negative, and the same for the end position, bound position between 0 and 100
- #349 updating dragger position was extending the stage when dragging past the end edge, set a boundary around max drag to prevent this.
- #321 set an maximum end seek limit or else playback completion may fail.
- #353 if player has ended or in a waiting state do not resize progress bars when going in/out of fullscreen
- fixed #215
- #390 regression issue with updating with maxDrag inside a buffer use full scrubbar dimensions as boundary is contained elsewhere.
- #403 Seeking is a percentage of the seekbar so set a more accurate value.
- #404 stop/start dragger animation when switching to update correctly.
- #403 prevent drag correctly for http streams, and reset seek limit to full range.
- #481 regression issue caused by previous fix for scrubber resizing on stream completion.
- #483 move up button mode config to detect enabled state, toggle slider enabled / disabled colour correctly.
- #483 only run the stage event once to prevent re-enabling unnecessarily.
- cleanup redundant reference to the controlbar.
- #485 initialise autohide config with fullscreenOnly disabled or else causes issues when configuring as enabled.

-----
