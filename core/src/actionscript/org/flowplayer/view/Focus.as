/*

This code is based on Adobe's SWFFocus class. 
The original SWFFocus class is designed to resolve the accessibility issue in browsers other than Internet Explorer
when users can't access player controls by keyboard alone. This accessibility issue can be viewed in 2 parts:

1. User can't access player's controls, tabbing skips over the player.
2. Once user has a focus on player's controls, he can tab through player's controls, but he is 'trapped' inside the player and can't 
shift focus back to the html page elements.

Task #1 is not working in several browsers including Chrome and Opera on Windows. This issue is resolved by javascript code and does not require changes
in the AS. 

Task #2 is resolved by this class and is using the same idea as Adobe's SWFFocus class uses - it injects javascript code into html page embedding the player.
The code monitors objects receiving the focus and once the user has made a full circle (the first object received a focus again) it injects the javascript
that shifts focus to the designated "next" html element on the page embedding the player.
